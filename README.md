# Dendro-LogDelay

Delay VST3 plugin made with Pure Data. The space between each echo is determied by a logarithmic scale, making it shorter every time. 

You must keep all the files (except for README.md and licence) on the same folder for the plugin to work correctly. If you are not interested on the patch itself, and only want to use the plugin on your DAW, I suggest to hide the png, txt, and pd files.
